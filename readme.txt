Show a dropdown select as the cities input on WooCommerce. Auto set the postcode for selected city.

== Description ==

This plubin is based on [WC City Select](https://tw.wordpress.org/plugins/wc-city-select/)

WooCommerce uses a text input for the customers to enter the city or town.
With this plugin you can provide a list of cities to be shown as a select dropdown.

This will be shown in checkout pages, edit addresses pages and shipping calculator if it's configured that way.

After selected the city or town, auto set the postcode number if is defined.

### How to add cities

A list of cities can be added in your theme functions.php file.

Use `ry_wc_city_select_cities` filter to load your cities.
This is done similarly to [Add/Modify States](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/addmodify-states/).
It should be added on your functions.php or a custom plugin.

`
add_filter( 'ry_wc_city_select_cities', 'my_cities' );
/**
 * Replace XX with the country code. Instead of YYY, ZZZ use actual state codes.
 * The City list can list of city name with postcode or just city name.
 */
function my_cities( $cities ) {
    $cities['XX'] = array(
        'YYY' => array( // city name with postcoe
            ['City', '100'],
            ['Another City', '101']
        ),
        'ZZZ' => array( // just city name
            'City 3',
            'City 4'
        )
    );
    return $cities;
}
